# Water [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/waterjs/water.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/waterjs/water)
Water is a micro-frontend ~~framework~~ ~~library~~ compiler for building user interfaces.
* **Minimal:** No overhead from framework runtime. Water transforms your declarative templates into imperative DOM manipulations.
* **Easy:** No explicit bindings. Water is smart enough to reactify component properties.
* **Component-based (seriously):** No dependencies enforced for componentization. You are free to compose your page with other components as there is no trace of Water at all.
